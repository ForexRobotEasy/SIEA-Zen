## Libraries Used
The following libraries are included in the code to support trading operations:

- EURUSD
- USDJPY
- GBPUSD
- USDCHF
- AUDUSD
- USDCAD
- NZDUSD
- EURJPY
- EURGBP

## Trading Function
The code includes a `trade` function that is responsible for implementing the trading logic. This function takes a `TradingPairs` parameter to determine the trading pair to be traded. The actual trading logic implementation is not provided in the code and should be added by the user.

## Main Program
The main program, `OnStart`, enables trading for all 28 trading pairs defined in the `TradingPairs` enum. It iterates over each trading pair and calls the `trade` function to execute the trading logic.
